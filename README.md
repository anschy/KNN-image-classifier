# KNN-image-classifier

the file above is a basic file for Image classification using KNN, where we classify the images with the help of L1 ("Manhattan Distance") between each pixels of the test and train images, thus the values i.e. the differemces between the pixels are added and if the values crosses a certain threshold then the image can be classified to one group or the other.
